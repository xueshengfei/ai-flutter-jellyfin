### 2.2 **Permission Requirements**

The following permissions include the `system_basic` permission, but the default application permission is `normal`. Only the `normal` permission can be used. Therefore, the error **9568289** may be reported during the installation of the HAP package. For details, see [Document](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/bm-tool-V5#EN_TOPIC_0000001884757326__%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%85hap%E6%97%B6%E6%8F%90%E7%A4%BAcode9568289-error-install-failed-due-to-grant-request-permissions-failed) Change the application level to `system_basic`.

        "reason": "$string:network_reason",
        "usedScene": {
